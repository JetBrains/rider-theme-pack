## Color scheme editing

After making changes to the color scheme files (`colorSchemes\*.xml`) apply the sorting utility
`tools\PrettyXML.py` to make these files have the same order of elements and attributes. 
This utility requires Python 3.7+ 

There is an IDEA run configuration 'Sort color scheme files' for that task.

#### Rider-specific color themes (`Rider*.xml`)

These files are created by a utility which is not published yet. Please don't edit them manually, 
these changes will be lost.
